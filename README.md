Uses naive method of recursively traversing through the project directory,  
and checking extensions of each file.

  * activate virtualenv `source env/bin/activate` in linux/mac and `/env/Source/activate` in Windows  
  * install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
  * run the project `python3.6 travpro.py -h`
